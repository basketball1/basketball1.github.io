## The Basketball

I normally use the basketball called "Wilson" because I peronally think that it has better quality on how it bounces. 

## Pros

I like it because it is an indoor basketball and I like the texture of it. It is really usefull when you want to play indoor and there is a different basketball for outdoor. The wilson basketball just works more indoors and it is mostly used indoors. The bounce for the Wilson basketball is 4.5/5. and the feel is 5/5. It is moslty used in college basketball it is pretty much used in professional.

## Cons

One thing I don't like is you can't use it outside. It's an indoor only basketball.
