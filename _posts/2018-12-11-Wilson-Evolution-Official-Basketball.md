i normally use the basketball called "wilson" because i peronally think that it has better quality on how it bounces.
 i like it because it is an indoor basketball and i like the texture of it. it is really usefull when you want to play indoor and there is a different basketball for outdoor. the wilson basketball just works more indoors and it is mostly used indoors. the bounce for the wilson basketball is 4.5/5. and the feel is 5/5. it is moslty used in college basketball it is pretty much used in professional basketball.
