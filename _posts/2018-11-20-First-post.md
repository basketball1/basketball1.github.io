## Pre-season
This year’s season should be good. It started on november 6th I couldn't wait for that day to come.   


## The best game
The best game i ever saw was notre dame v.s mississippi state. They scored right when the timer was about to go out.

## My favorite player
My favorite player is bonzie colson. I can also say that some players are better than others but i like bonzie colson because she is tuff and really good at basketball.
